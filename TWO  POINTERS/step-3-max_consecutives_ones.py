Example 1:
Input:  nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2  
Output: 6  
Explanation: Flip 2 zeros at indices 5 and 10 to get 6 consecutive 1s.

Example 2:
Input:  nums = [0,0,1,1,1,0,0], k = 0  
Output: 3

🕒 Time Complexity: O(n)  
    - Each element is visited at most twice by left and right pointers.

📦 Space Complexity: O(1)  
    - No extra space used other than a few variables.
