"""
ðŸ“Œ Problem: Longest Common Prefix (LeetCode #14)
-----------------------------------------------

ðŸ§  Task:
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

ðŸ“ˆ Time Complexity:
- O(S) where S is the sum of all characters in all strings

ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity:
- O(1) â€” only constant extra space used (excluding input/output)

ðŸ›  Approach:
- Take the first string as the reference
- Loop through each character of the first string
- Check if all other strings have the same character at that index
- If not, return the prefix up to that point

            # Compare this character with the same position in all other strings
            for word in strs[1:]:
                # If index i is out of bounds or characters don't match, return the prefix so far
                if i >= len(word) or word[i] != char:
                    return strs[0][:i]

        # If all characters of the first word match in others
        return strs[0]
